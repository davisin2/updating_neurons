## Generative AI --   

### Understanding what ANN can process 
<ol>
  <li> Can process labeled and unlabeled data  </li>
  <li> This learning of labeled and unlabeled data is know as semi-supervised learning </li>
  <li> In semi-supervised learning ANN is trained in small amount of labeled and large amount of unlabeled data  </li>
  <li> Inshort unlabeled data help AI to generalize things to under </li>
</ol>

## Finally Generative AI 
<li> Is a subsuet of Deep learning which means it usage ANN that can process Labeled and unlabeled data </li>
<li> To process data GenAI is using supervised , unsupervised and semi-supervised Methods </li>


### LLM's are also subset of Deep learning

# Finally -- Deep learning models can be divided into Two catagory
